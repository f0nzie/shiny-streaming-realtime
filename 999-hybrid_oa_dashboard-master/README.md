# A reproducible dashboard for monitoring hybrid open acccess uptake with R

Source code and data repository for the hybrid open access dashboard, using [flexdashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/flexdashboard) and [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com).

A live demo is available here:

<https://najkoja.shinyapps.io/hybridoa/>

## Requirements

```r
install.packages(c("flexdashboard", "dplyr", "readr", "plotly", "scales", "ggalt"), dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Running the dashboard locally

```r
rmarkdown::run("dashboard.Rmd")
```

## Methods and data

Methods used are available in the R folder. [`R/cr_fetching.R`](R/cr_fetching.R) describes how licensing and journal metadata were obtained from [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/), using the [rcrossref](https://github.com/ropensci/rcrossref) client, developed and maintained by the rOpenSci initiative (https://ropensci.org/). [`R/oapc.R`](R/oapc.R) shows how cost information was analysed.

|`year_publisher_all`|Yearly article volume of all journals in the dataset per publisher |                              |
|`license_ref_n`     |Yearly article volume under the license `license`                  |


#### Licensing metadata

[data/jn_facets_df.json](data/jn_facets_df.json) contains journal article volume and corresponding licensing information for the period  2013 - 2017 for each ISSN found in the Open APC dataset representing a hybrid OA journal.

[data/hybrid_license_df.json](data/jn_facets_df.json) stores information about journals with licensing metadata representing hybrid OA journal articles (excluding delayed OA and licenses that only govern text mining)
